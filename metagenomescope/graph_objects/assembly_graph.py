        It is assumed that scale_nodes() has already been called; otherwise,
        this will be unable to access the relative_length and
        longside_proportion node attributes, which will cause a KeyError.

        This only covers "bottom-level" nodes -- i.e. patterns are not assigned
        dimensions, since those should be scaled based on the bounding box
        needed to contain their child elements. However, "duplicate" nodes
        should be assigned dimensions, since for all intents and purposes
        they're "real". (It may be possible to speed this up slightly by only
        duplicating data for these nodes after doing scaling, etc., but I doubt
        that the time savings there will be that useful in most cases.)

        It is very important to understand that here, "height" and "width"
        refer to nodes' positions in the graph when laid out from top to
        bottom:
         __
        |  |
        |  |

        Although Graphviz does accept a "rankdir" graph attribute that can be
        used to make graph drawings flow from left to right, rather than from
        top to bottom, this attribute is not respected when *just* laying out
        the graph. At least to my knowledge. So unfortunately we have to do the
        rotation ourselves. Therefore, in the visualization interface shown to
        MetagenomeScope users, the width and height of each node are really the
        opposite from what we store here.

        If this graph has edge weights, this assigns two new attributes for
        each edge:

        1. is_outlier: one of -1, 0, or 1. Ways to interpret this:
            -1: This edge's weight is a low outlier
             0: This edge's weight is not an outlier
             1: This edge's weight is a high outlier

           NOTE that if the graph has less than 4 edges, this'll just set all
           of their is_outlier values to 0 (since with such a small number of
           data points the notion of "outliers" kinda breaks apart).

        2. relative_weight: a number in the range [0, 1]. If this edge is not
           an outlier, this corresponds to where this edge's weight falls
           within a range between the minimum non-outlier edge weight and the
           maximum non-outlier edge weight. If this edge is a low outlier, this
           will just be 0, and if this edge is a high outlier, this will just
           be 1.

        If edge weight scaling cannot be done for some or all edges
        (e.g. no edge weight data is available, or only one non-outlier edge
        exists) then this will assign is_outlier = 0 and relative_weight = 0.5
        to the impacted edges.

        Relative scaling will only be done for non-outlier edges. This helps
        make things look more consistent.

        Outlier detection is done using "inner" Tukey fences, as described in
